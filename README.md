## About

Mental health disorder or illness is an area of health challenges that has continued to widely pain the society in which we live despite the fact that treatment is available. Various people from different parts of the world have had to deal with this issue for various unique or similar reasons. This condition has gone on to impact the lives of the affected people in various ways. There exists a number of scientific-backed solutions that have been proven to help to combat this situation. Most of these solutions involve interaction with health professionals. 
However, mental health problems are usually associated with a lot of stigma which may make it difficult for some people to come out and seek help. For this reason, it is crucial to provide another outlet or outlet through which patients can get useful information to help them to deal with the situation. Mental health disorder is common in our society more than you may ever think. 

For instance in Nigeria, It is estimated by World Health Organization (WHO) that One in four Nigerians - some 50 million people - are suffering from some sort of mental illness. A country of 200 million with only 150 psychiatrists resulting to about 1 ratio 100,000 specialist to patients. WHO further estimates that fewer than 10 percent of mentally ill Nigerians have access to the care they need. This in turn has resulted to an overwhelming workload for the mental health specialist and many patients inability to get consultantation or treatment at all. Read more about mental health disorder down below this page.

In view of the problem statement above, a viable solution would be to provide a platform through which patients can get useful information that can assist them to deal with mental health problems. Majority of the available tech intervention use generic web pages as a means of providing useful information and connecting mental health patients to Therapists. This can be boring, overwhelming and hinder information access as mental health is always associated with lot of depression. Imaging already depressed people having to navigate through tons of web pages to get the help they need.
 The idea proposed in this project uses machine learning on the various pieces of health data to try to diagnose patients for the various types of mental health problems that they have and propose solutions accordingly.
The approach taken is to use an intelligent therapy agent (chat bot) that patients can interact with and get the information that can assist their unique conditions anywhere and get connected to human therapist nearby only when it is needed. 

## Usage

### How it work

Swiftana is a mental health assistant bot aimed to help provide remedies to this ravaging mental health problems baffling our society. Swiftana work by given recommendations on possible cure or remedies base on the users health issues or sysmtoms. In a situation whereby the bot can not handle the user request or the user need to talk to a real human consultant, the bot connect them to nearby specialist or outpatient clinic in their location. The project is in line with the Sustainable Development Goal(SDG goal 3), problem statmeent 1 of the Andela build for SDG project. 

### Usage
A user goes online and accesses the bot using a given URL (mobile app will be put in place in the future for offline usage) after which they can start interacting with the system. The user can type in any relevant information and the bot will give a relevant response accordingly. The bot suggests possible remedies or recommendations that the user can make use of to assist them with their various conditions. After successful interaction, the bot suggests the nearest hospitals that offer mental health services that the patients can visit in order to seek further assistance. 

### Practical usage
1. Visit https://lit-dusk-59445.herokuapp.com/
2. Reply the bot by typing "Hello"
3. Further the instruction by typing  "one" or "two"
4. Type "Thinking suicide"
5. Then type "nearest hospital" to get connect to real specialist nearby
6. Enter "Nigeria" as your location
7. You will get a list of specialist

	However, scientists don’t know if this happens before or after the onset of depressive symptoms.
- Medical conditions: Certain conditions may put you at higher risk, such as chronic illness, insomnia, chronic pain, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
- Drug use: A history of drug or alcohol misuse can affect your risk.

DEPRESSION TEST

There isn’t a single test to diagnose depression.
But your healthcare provider can make a diagnosis based on the symptoms and a psychological evaluation.
Some of the questions asked include:
-moods
-appetite
-sleep pattern
-activity level
-thoughts
Health issues such as thyroid problems or a vitamin D deficiency can trigger symptoms of depression.

DANGERS OF DEPRESSION

Treatment for depression
Living with depression can be difficult, but treatment can help improve your quality of life. Talk to your healthcare provider about possible options.
You may successfully manage symptoms with one form of treatment, or you may find that a combination of treatments works best.
It’s common to combine medical treatments and lifestyle therapies, including the following:
Medications
Your healthcare provider may prescribe:
•	antidepressants
•	antianxiety
•	antipsychotic medications
Each type of medication that’s used to treat depression has benefits and potential risks.

Psychotherapy
Speaking with a therapist can help you learn skills to cope with negative feelings. You may also benefit from family or group therapy sessions.

Light therapy
Exposure to doses of white light can help regulate your mood and improve symptoms of depression. Light therapy is commonly used in seasonal affective disorder, which is now called major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern.
Alternative therapies
Ask your healthcare provider about acupuncture or meditation. Some herbal supplements are also used to treat depression, like St. John’s wort, SAMe, and fish oil.
Talk with your healthcare provider before taking a supplement or combining a supplement with prescription medication because some supplements can react with certain medications. Some supplements may also worsen depression or reduce the effectiveness of medication.
Exercise
Aim for 30 minutes of physical activity 3 to 5 days a week. Exercise can increase your body’s production of endorphins, which are hormones that improve your mood.

Avoid alcohol and drugs
Drinking or misusing drugs may make you feel better for a little bit. But in the long run, these substances can make depression and anxiety symptoms worse.

Learn how to say no
Feeling overwhelmed can worsen anxiety and depression symptoms. Setting boundaries in your professional and personal life can help you feel better.

Take care of yourself
You can also improve symptoms of depression by taking care of yourself. This includes getting plenty of sleep, eating a healthy diet, avoiding negative people, and participating in enjoyable activities.

Sometimes depression doesn’t respond to medication. Your healthcare provider may recommend other treatment options if your symptoms don’t improve.

These include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat depression and improve your mood.


Natural treatment for depression
Traditional depression treatment uses a combination of prescription medication and counseling. But there are also alternative or complementary treatments you can try.
It’s important to remember that many of these natural treatments have few studies showing their effects on depression, good or bad.
Likewise, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t approve many of the dietary supplements on the market in the United States, so you want to make sure you’re buying products from a trustworthy brand.
Talk to your healthcare provider before adding supplements to your treatment plan.

Supplements
Several types of supplements are thought to have some positive effect on depression symptoms.
St. John’s wort
Studies are mixed, but this natural treatment is used in Europe as an antidepressant medication. In the United States, it hasn’t received the same approval.
S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe)
This compound has shown in limited studies to possibly ease symptoms of depression. The effects were best seen in people taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a type of traditional antidepressant.
5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)
5-HTP may raise serotonin levels in the brain, which could ease symptoms. Your body makes this chemical when you consume tryptophan, a protein building block.
Omega-3 fatty acids
These essential fats are important to neurological development and brain health. Adding omega-3 supplements to your diet may help reduce depression symptoms.
Essential oils
Essential oils are a popular natural remedy for many conditions, but research into their effects on depression is limited.
People with depression may find symptom relief with the following essential oils:
Wild ginger: Inhaling this strong scent may activate serotonin receptors in your brain. This may slow the release of stress-inducing hormones.
Bergamot: This citrusy essential oil has been shown to reduce anxiety in patients awaiting surgery. The same benefit may help individuals who experience anxiety as a result of depression, but there’s no research to support that claim.
Other oils, such as chamomile or rose oil, may have a calming effect when they’re inhaled. Those oils may be beneficial during short-term use.
Vitamins
Vitamins are important to many bodily functions. Research suggests two vitamins are especially useful for easing symptoms of depression:
Vitamin B: B-12 and B-6 are vital to brain health. When your vitamin B levels are low, your risk for developing depression may be higher.
Vitamin D: Sometimes called the sunshine vitamin because exposure to the sun supplies it to your body, Vitamin D is important for brain, heart, and bone health. People who are depressed are more likely to have low levels of this vitamin.
Many herbs, supplements, and vitamins claim to help ease symptoms of depression, but most haven’t shown themselves to be effective in clinical research.

Learn about herbs, vitamins, and supplements that have shown some promise, and ask your healthcare provider if any are right for you.
